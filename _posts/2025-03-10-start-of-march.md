<h2>thoughts lately: </h2>
<p>Theres not really a spring in Hong Kong, not that there's really a winter either. I think that, like Canada, we will go from one season to the next in the blink of an eye. 
One day it will be 15 degrees and then next it will be 30 with 100% humidity. I find myself missing the British spring. I've never had much of an issue with London weather 
and spring, for me, is by far the season I feel I have benefited the most from. A season of "Wow how beautiful" at every single flowering tree, a photoroll full of every single flower I see, and seasonal allergies so bad it triggers my asthma. 
Another reason I love spring is simply the knowledge that I am moving into a new chapter. Winter is coming to an end, summer will be here soon, it is spring! I guess the struggle with Hong Kong
is that every season feels the same, at least with my windows closed. Looking out the window, everyday is the exact same green plants and blue skies. While I'm not complaing, I am simply stating that 
today feels like yesterday, and last week, and 6 months ago. I have always grown up with a visable change of seasons, and here there doesn't seem to be one. I will look for another way to usher in a new chapter in my brain. </p>
