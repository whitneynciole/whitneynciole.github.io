      <p>Hey there, I'm Whitney. This is my tiny slice of the internet, 
        <br> there's not much here right now, but thats alright. 
        <br> Maybe one day it will be full! Full of what? I don't know.  
        <br> Words? Pictures? Tiny, shimmering thoughts?
        <br>A few little rules for your visit: 
        
        <div class="list-container">
        <ul class="small-list">
        <li>No stomping on other people's dreams (or their imaginary gardens).</li>
        <li>Take what inspires you, but don't take what isn't yours.   <br> Admire, appreciate, but no pocketing the shiny things.</li>
        <li>No meanies, no grumps, no joy-stealers.</li>
        <li>If you're going to critique, do it like a friendly ghost—gently,   <br>kindly, with good intentions.</li>
        <li>Typos are just words being a little whimsical. Let them be.</li>
        <li>Bring good energy. Curiosity, wonder,   <br>kindness—like bringing flowers to a friend's house.</li>
        <li>And most of all—enjoy. This space is here for a reason,   <br>and maybe that reason is you.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p> That's all. That's it. Stay as long as you like.</p>
    <p>"I am that mysterious stranger that I hoped to meet. 
    <br>I met her at a dark dance. 
    <br>We came here to live together until I could stay by myself. 
    <br>The place is here. The time is now. 
    <br>This is all my lifetime.”
    <br>                             ― Jenny Slate, Little Weirds</p>
